## 📖 Biography

Hi! I'm Yufei Wei (魏雨飞), a Ph.D. student at the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Yue Wang and Prof. Rong Xiong. My research centers on 3D visual perception, world models, and embodied AI — I'm driven by the vision of enabling robots to genuinely understand and interact with the real world, not just move through it.

My earlier work focused on monocular visual odometry, Bird's-Eye View representations, and visual localization, published in journals and conferences including IEEE RA-L and IROS. These efforts addressed real-world challenges in reducing scale drift and achieving robust localization for mobile robots in complex environments. As a collaborator, I've also contributed to projects spanning learning-based navigation planning, multi-sensor fusion localization, and applications in  agricultural automation and medical robotics. Currently, I'm exploring world model construction and vision-and-language navigation, focusing on cross-modal integration through unified representations, and leveraging multimodal LLMs for scene understanding and navigation tasks.

During my undergraduate years, I led teams to three national championships in autonomous driving and robotics competitions, contributed to the PaddlePaddle open-source community, and developed a lightweight autonomous delivery vehicle. I also served as team leader for an intelligent ergonomic chair startup at Zexiang Li's Entrepreneurship Incubator in Shenzhen and spent time teaching at a primary school in Yulin, Guangxi. During my internship at Shenzhen InnoX Academy, I deployed LiDAR-IMU SLAM and developed obstacle avoidance algorithms for street sweeping vehicles. Whether in research or real-world deployment, I prioritize building systems that actually work over chasing theoretical elegance alone.

I'm always excited to collaborate, discuss ideas, and learn from others. If you're working on visual perception, world models, embodied AI, or anything that brings robots closer to understanding our world, let's chat! 🤖

<img src="paper_images/bev_odom2.jpg" alt="BEV-ODOM2" width="600"/>
</div>

**Authors:** **Yufei Wei**, Wangtao Lu, Sha Lu, Chenxiao Hu, Fuzhang Han, Rong Xiong, Yue Wang  
**Venue:** IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS) - **Under Review**  
**Description:** BEV-ODOM2 introduces dense BEV optical flow supervision constructed directly from pose ground truth and PV-BEV dual-branch fusion to address sparse supervision and information loss without additional annotations. Achieving 40% RTE improvement over existing BEV methods, it delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while maintaining superior scale consistency. **(Under Review)**

#### 📄 BEV-DWPVO: BEV-based Differentiable Weighted Procrustes for Low Scale-drift Monocular Visual Odometry on Ground

<div align="center">
<img src="paper_images/bev_dwpvo.jpg" alt="BEV-DWPVO" width="600"/>
</div>

**Authors:** **Yufei Wei**, Sha Lu, Wangtao Lu, Rong Xiong, Yue Wang  
**Venue:** IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2025  
**Description:** BEV-DWPVO leverages unified metric-scaled BEV representation and differentiable weighted Procrustes solver to address scale drift in monocular visual odometry. By simplifying pose estimation to 3-DoF and training end-to-end with only pose supervision, it achieves best average RTE of 8.67% and 6.92% on NCLT and Oxford datasets, delivering superior scale consistency without requiring depth estimation or segmentation supervision.

#### 📄 BEV-ODOM: Reducing Scale Drift in Monocular Visual Odometry with BEV Representation

<div align="center">
<img src="paper_images/bev_odom.jpg" alt="BEV-ODOM" width="600"/>
</div>

**Authors:** **Yufei Wei**, Sha Lu, Fuzhang Han, Rong Xiong, Yue Wang  
**Venue:** 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 349-356  
**Description:** BEV-ODOM is the first to demonstrate that BEV representation alone, without segmentation or auxiliary tasks, can achieve low scale drift in monocular visual odometry. Using correlation-based feature extraction and 3-DoF pose regression with only pose supervision, it reveals that scale consistency originates from BEV's inherent metric-scaled grid structure rather than side-tasks, providing a simpler and more interpretable approach.

**Venue:** 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 3883-3889  
**Description:** This work proposes a hierarchical architecture integrating low-frequency parameter tuning (1Hz), mid-frequency planning (10Hz), and high-frequency control (50Hz) for autonomous navigation. An RL-based feedback controller is introduced to minimize tracking errors that cannot be resolved through parameter tuning alone. Through alternating training between the parameter tuning network and controller, the method achieves 98% success rate and 10.2s completion time on BARN Challenge, winning first place.

## 🌟 Beyond Research

### 🏫 广西玉林-古城小学支教

2019 年盛夏，我随支教队来到广西玉林古城小学，兼任英语老师和班主任，在潮湿闷热与忽晴忽雨的天气里，与几十个性格迥异的孩子一起度过了难忘的三周。最初从慌乱铺床、紧张上课，到熟悉校园每个角落、能够从容站上讲台，我在备课、带班、家访和无数次"崩溃-重整"的循环中，慢慢学会了承担、耐心与真正意义上的陪伴。孩子们一句"老师，你讲得好有意思"、几份终于不再抄袭的作业,和他们在暴雨后操场上肆意奔跑的身影，始终是我跨过高烧、争执与自我怀疑的力量来源。

小时候看过一部关于拐卖的纪录片，从那时起，我便一直怀揣着想要解决拐卖的问题。这个梦想至今仍遥远，但在这所偏远的山村小学，在 2019 年那个潮湿的夏天，我第一次真切意识到：教育与守护是预防伤害的第一道防线，也是为孩子们在深山穹顶上打开的一扇天窗。离开古城小学后，我仍常想起那些在黄昏灯光下写作业、在最后一晚的月光下与我道别的孩子们——愿我当时笨拙却真诚的努力，能在他们的人生里留下哪怕一点点温暖而长久的光。

我们的核心技术结合了压力传感矩阵、背部传感器与机器学习算法，能够精准识别用户身份、臀部位置与坐姿，并据此自动调整支撑力度。我们的支撑系统采用机械推杆与多分区气囊组合，机械部分负责大范围调节，气囊则提供精细调整，支持全自动、半自动和手动调节。通过App与实体按键的交互，系统能不断学习并优化用户习惯，实现个性化的追背与腰骶骨支撑效果。在此过程中，我带领团队运用第一性原理分析问题，并通过最小子系统迭代验证方案，成功完成了三代功能样机，涵盖了从结构设计、控制电路到算法验证、供应链与专利布局的完整流程，并顺利获得了天使轮融资机会。
